# Lab 02 - VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing Setup

## Objective
Configure VLANs on switches, set up router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing, and verify connectivity between VLANs using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Lab Setup
- 2 Switches
- 1 Router
- 4 PCs (2 PCs per VLAN)

## Steps
1. Create VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 on both switches.
2. Assign switch ports to appropriate VLANs.
3. Configure trunk ports between switches and router.
4. Configure router subinterfaces with dot1Q encapsulation for VLANs.
5. Assign IP addresses to PCs in respective VLAN subnets.
6. Test connectivity between PCs and router subinterfaces.
7. Troubleshoot any connectivity issues.

## Key Learnings
- VLAN creation and port assignment
- Trunk port configuration
- Router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing concept
- Basic network troubleshooting commands
